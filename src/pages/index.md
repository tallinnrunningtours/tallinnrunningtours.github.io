## Logistics
- **Start time**: This is highly tailored to your needs. Not an early riser? No problem. Feel like going out after lunch? Absolutely. Let us know in the booking what time you'd like to start between 08:00-19:00 so we can plan accordingly (subject to availability)
- **Start / Finish location**: Most routes start and finish by [Viru Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N3jNP5vX5Eu6wLve6). Let us know in the booking if you'd prefer to start/finish elsewhere (e.g. by your hotel, by a bar 🍺 ).
- **Pace**: By default we will aim for 6min/km (10min/mile) pace to start with.  
- **Will we stop?**: All runs include photo stops where you can take photos and fueling stops for anything you've brought along.
- **Grouping**: If there is high demand for the same route on the same day, you may be grouped with other runners. If you'd prefer a private run, let us know.

## Bookings and Cancellations
- Bookings: We accept bookings made at least **24 hours in advance** (subject to availability). 
- Cancellations: Please allow at least 24-hour notice for any cancellations no matter the reason. This means that we can attend to other runners during your slot.


## Important❗
1. To help us keep the tours running, feel free to [tip to support our back office activities](https://revolut.me/isaacvui7)!
2. We are local runners and _not_ official tour guides, but we'll do our best to drop some fun facts along the way. 
3. Dress for the weather. Estonia can be very cold, windy, and icy during the winter and warm in the summer. So be sure to dress appropriately.
4. Above all, have fun! 🎉
