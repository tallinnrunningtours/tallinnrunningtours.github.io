## Logistics :truck:
- **Start time**: This is highly tailored to your needs. Not an early riser? No problem. Feel like going out after lunch? Absolutely. Let us know in the booking what time you'd like to start so we can plan accordingly (subject to availability)
- **Start / Finish location**: Most routes start and finish by [Viru Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N3jNP5vX5Eu6wLve6). Let us know in the booking if you'd prefer to start/finish elsewhere (e.g. by your hotel, by a bar 🍺 ).
- **Pace**: By default we will aim for 6min/km (10min/mile) pace to start with. During the run, we will check in with you often as well. 
- **What does this include?**: All runs include photo stops where you can take photos and fueling stops for anything you've brought along.

## Bookings and Cancellations
- Bookings: You are welcome to book at least **24 hours in advance** (subject to availability). Start times are between 08:00-19:00.
- Cancellations: Please allow at least 24-hour notice for any cancellations no matter the reason. This means that we can attend to other runners during your slot.


## Important❗
1. 💰 To help us keep the tours running, feel free to [tip to support our back office activities](https://revolut.me/isaacvui7)!
2. 🏃‍♂️ We are local runners and _not_ official tour guides, but we'll do our best to drop some fun facts along the way. 
3. ❄️ Dress for the weather. Estonia can be very cold, windy, and icy during the winter and warm in the summer. So be sure to dress appropriately.
4. 🎉 Above all, have fun!
